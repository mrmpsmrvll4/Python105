4/22/24, 9:52, It seems I am writing an entry into my diary and I can't think of anything to say.
4/23/24, 9:53, I still can't think of anything to say other than that I changed the date even though today isn't the 23rd
4/24/24, 9:54, My last entry in this instance just so happens to be that I have concluded I don't have anything else to add to the nothing that I have said.
