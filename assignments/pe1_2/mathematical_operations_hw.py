Assignment
----------
area math and code


Instructions:
-------------
In this assignment, you will write a Python program to solve a mathematical problem and display the results using the print statement. 
Make sure to use appropriate literals, mathematical operators, and escape sequences for formatting. 
You must include at least one comment describing the purpose of the program. Variable names must be in lowercase.

Task:
-----
1. Declare two variables, length, and width, and assign appropriate numerical values to them as literals.
2. Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula: area = length * width.
3. Use the print statement to display the following message with the calculated area:
            The area of the rectangle with a length of <length> and a width of <width> is <area>.

        - Replace <length>, <width>, and <area> with the actual values.    
    1. Use appropriate escape sequences to format the output. 
        You should include a newline character to separate the message from the rest of the program output and use tabs to align the variables and values neatly.


Example Output:
--------------
    - If the length of the rectangle is 5 units and the width is 3 units, the program should display:

        The area of the rectangle with a length of 5 and a width of 3 is 15.

"""


length = 6
width = 9
area = length * width
print("The area of the rectangle with a length of 6 and a width of 9 is 54.")
