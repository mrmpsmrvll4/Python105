Python Programming Assignment: Flower List Manager
 

Objective: Create a Python program to manage a list of flowers. 
This includes sorting the list, searching for specific flowers, and handling exceptions using try and except statements.

Requirements:
------------
1. Create a Main Function: Encapsulate your program within a main() function.
2. User Input for Flower List: Prompt the user to enter names of flowers and store them in a list. 
    Have them enter the word "done" when done, and check for it.
3. Sorting and Searching: Sort the list, print on screen with a number next to the flower name, 
    and allow the user to search for a specific flower. Print a message if the flower is found.
4. Accessing a Specific Flower: Ask the user for a number to access the corresponding flower. 
    Handle errors for invalid inputs. 
    (Note, our printout starts at 1, list indexes start at 0, adjust accordingly.
5. Exception Handling: Use try and except statements for ValueError and IndexError, and include a generic except statement.

Example Code Structure:
-----------------------

def main():
    # Your code here


main()
