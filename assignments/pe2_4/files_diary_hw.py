Objective: Create a Python program that functions as a personal diary. Users should be able to add entries with the date and time they provide, which are then saved to a file.
----------
Detailed Directions
1. Set Up Your Python Environment: Create a diary folder for this assignment, you will upload the whole file to GitHub when you are done. 
2. Create a New Python File: Name this file personal_diary.py.
3. Writing the Code:
    - Create this in a main function
    - Prompt the user to enter the current date and time, then a diary entry.
    - Open or create a file named diary.txt in append mode using open().
    - Write the user-provided date, time, and diary entry into the file.

    - Close the file using the close() method.
4. Comments and Documentation: Add comments to your code explaining its functionality.
5. Testing the Program: Run personal_diary.py three times, each time entering a different diary entry along with the date and time. Check diary.txt to ensure entries are recorded correctly.
